## About the Community Health Assessment

The CHA is a systematic assessment of population health in Philadelphia, highlighting key public health challenges and assets and informing local public health programs, policies, and partnerships. The CHA includes indicators reflecting health behaviors, health conditions, health care factors, and social and environmental determinants of health.

The Community Health Explorer is a joint project between the City of Philadelphia's [Department of Public Health](http://www.phila.gov/health/) and [Office of Open Data and Digital Transformation](https://alpha.phila.gov/departments/office-of-the-chief-administrative-officer/functions/office-of-open-data-and-digital-transformation/).

The Explorer is intended to provide easy-to-use, responsive and accessible visualization tools for viewing the vast amount of data collected annually for the Community Health Assessment.

The Community Health Assessment report is [available for download](http://www.phila.gov/health/commissioner/DataResearch.html) on the Department of Public Health site.
